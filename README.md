# WOOO!! ðŸŽ‰

Thought I would discipline myself. Feel free to judge me for premature optimization, naming conventions, commit messagesâ€”no really, open an issue or PR and I'll try to better myself.

## Structure


### Overview
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .clang-format
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ .playground/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ [level]/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ compile_flags.txt
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### Levels
```
[level]
â”œâ”€â”€ [category]
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [problem]
â”‚   â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.cpp
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ x
â””â”€â”€ x
```

`[level]`: Canonical USACO levels
`[category]`: As outlined by the [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide)
`[problem]`: USACO problems (mostly those suggested by the guide)

### Playground
```
.playground
â”œâ”€â”€ [topic]
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ comp.cpp
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ idiomatic.cpp
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [other].cpp
â””â”€â”€ x
```

The playground is broken down into topics (e.g. `trees`, `graphs`), each of which has a `comp.cpp` (without best practices, to get used to writing contest-type solutions), sometimes an `idiomatic.cpp` (best practices, smart pointers, RAII, etc), and even sometimes another file with interesting deviations or implementations with a design pattern.
