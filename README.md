# WOOO!! ðŸŽ‰

Thought I would discipline myself while working through the [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide).

This repo is really just for personal growth, but feel free to judge me for premature optimization, naming conventions, commit messagesâ€”no really, open an issue or PR and I'll try to better myself; standards/requirements are basically just maintaining the repo structure and commit style (following sections).

> ðŸ”Ž *Please note: Iâ€™d only like feedback on problems Iâ€™ve already solved or on `playground` implementations. Those are the parts meant for collaboration.*

## Repo Structure

### Overview
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .playground
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ [level]
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ .clang-format
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ compile_flags.txt
```

### Levels
```
[level]
â”œâ”€â”€ [category]
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [problem]
â”‚   â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.cpp
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ x
â””â”€â”€ x
```

`[level]` â€” Canonical USACO levels

`[category]` â€” As outlined by the [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide)

`[problem]`Â â€” USACO problems (mostly those suggested by the guide)

For every category, there is a `README.md` listing all the problems in the category I've attempted and wish to attempt soon. It's named that so that GitHub opens it automatically when you select a category folder.

### Playground
```
.playground
â”œâ”€â”€ [topic]
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ comp.cpp
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ idiomatic.cpp
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [other].cpp
â””â”€â”€ x
```

The playground is broken down into topics (e.g. `trees`, `graphs`), each of which has a `comp.cpp` (without best practices; to get used to writing contest-type solutions), sometimes an `idiomatic.cpp` (best practices, smart pointers, RAII, etc), and even sometimes another file with interesting deviations or implementations with a design pattern.

## Version Tracking

Okay, as the main reason for this repo anyway is to keep myself accountable, I have this weird urge to keep everything organized when I'm locked in. Doing so, I've adopted a spin-off of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). I thought this would be nice and helpful. You can see some examples of this for yourself.

I've recently modified the message template to:

```
level(year contest, category, P#): name
```
So for example:
```
bronze(2016 open, complete search, P1): diamond collector
```
