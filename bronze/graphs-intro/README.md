#### Notes

In both [Hoofball](hoofball) and [Milk Factory](milk-factory), there was some type of graph that was impossible to make. For example, the following are examples of impossible structures (and by knowing which, you may leverage some technique to skip simulation or complete search):

- Hoofball: Disjoint cycles

- Milk Factory: Cycles (except 2-cycles)
